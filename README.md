## Introduction
This project involves the development of a basic 2D game using Unity, a powerful game development platform. The game features a player character controlled by the keyboard, platforms, enemies, collectibles, and simple physics-based interactions. The game also includes a scrolling background and parallax effect.

## Requirements
- Unity Hub (latest version)
- Unity Editor (version 2020.3 or later recommended)
- Visual Studio Code or any C# compatible IDE for scripting

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Unity Hub**: Download and install Unity Hub from [Unity's official website](https://unity.com/).
2. **Install Unity Editor**: Open Unity Hub, go to the `Installs` tab, and install the recommended version of Unity Editor (2020.3 or later).
3. **Clone the Project Repository**: Clone the project repository from GitHub or download the ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
4. **Open the Project in Unity**: Open Unity Hub, go to the `Projects` tab, and click on `Add`. Navigate to the directory where you cloned/extracted the project and select it. The project will open in Unity Editor.

## Running the Game
1. **Open the Main Scene**: In Unity Editor, navigate to the `Assets` folder in the Project window and open the `MainScene`.
2. **Play the Game**: Click on the `Play` button in the Unity Editor to run the game. You can control the player character using the following keyboard keys:
   - **Arrow Keys**: Move left and right
   - **Spacebar**: Jump
   - **'P' Key**: Pause/Unpause the game

## Project Structure
- **Assets**: Contains all the game assets, including scripts, prefabs, scenes, and other resources.
- **Scripts**: Contains C# scripts for game logic and controls.
- **Scenes**: Contains different scenes used in the game.
- **Prefabs**: Contains prefabricated game objects for easy reuse.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that all required dependencies and packages are installed in Unity Editor.
- For any issues or bugs, refer to the Unity documentation or seek help from the Unity community forums.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a foundational guide for understanding and creating basic 2D games using Unity. By following the setup instructions and exploring the project structure, developers can expand their knowledge and create more complex games.
